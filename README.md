# Axial-Deformation-Calculator

- As a requirement for Statics and Mechanics of Materials course, I applied my software skills into mechanical engineering principles by creating a calculator that can compute mechanical engineering values.
- I programmed a software in Java that calculates the axial deformation and tensile strength given input parameters of various units in Imperial and Metric measurements.
